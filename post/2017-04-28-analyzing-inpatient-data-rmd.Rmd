## Let's examine the Hospital Charge Dataset from data.gov
I wanted to analyse this dataset because I wanted to know the different charges among different providers

The dataset has the following columns: 

 - DRG Definition (diagnosis)                       
 - Provider Id                         
 - Provider Name                        
 - Provider Street Address             
 - Provider City                        
 - Provider State                      
 - Provider Zip Code                    
 - Hospital Referral Region Description
 - Total Discharges                     
 - Average Covered Charges             
 - Average Total Payments               
 - Average Medicare Payments  
 
 The Average Covered Charges differs with differing providers. This will be our column of interest. Let us take a look at its histogram after converting the column to a float.
