#### About the dataset

The dataset is [openly available](https://www.data.gov/health/). It portrays the provider summary for the top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) for the year 2011 in the US. 

DRGs only capture diagnosis groups which encompass related diagnoses for ease of classification and coding. However, this causes loss of details of individual diagnoses.

####Columns in the dataset

The dataset has the following columns: 

 - DRG Definition (diagnosis)                       
 - Provider Id                         
 - Provider Name                        
 - Provider Street Address             
 - Provider City                        
 - Provider State                      
 - Provider Zip Code                    
 - Hospital Referral Region Description
 - Total Discharges                     
 - Average Covered Charges             
 - Average Total Payments               
 - Average Medicare Payments  
 
Average Covered Charges differs with providers. This will be our column of interest. Let us take a look at its histogram:

####Exploring Outliers

The distribution is right-skewed as would be for most charges. Here are the top 5 charges

 Diagnosis | State | Charge
 ----------|-------|-------
 RESP SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS        |      CA       |          929118.9
 RESP SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS      |        CA     |            918023.2
 SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS      |        CA     |            637377.7
 SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS      |        CA     |            628730.4
 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS      |        PA     |            613926.6

It turns out that most 4 of them are from CA. This is understandable as CA is an expensive state. 

The "Ventilator support 96+ hours" in the diagnosis, unfortunately, does not differentiate between one week or one month. 

Septicemia and Respiratory System Diagnosis are expensive because they can be a complication of a number of diseases, prolonging hospital stay and increasing charges.



What are the top 5 most expensive diagnoses?

Diagnosis                                  | Average Charge
-------------------------------------------|----------------
SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS | $163227.33
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS |  $143428.05
INFECTIOUS & PARASITIC DISEASES W O.R. PROCEDURE W MCC |  $139186.35
MAJOR SMALL & LARGE BOWEL PROCEDURES W MCC | $135330.94
PERC CARDIOVASC PROC W DRUG-ELUTING STENT W MCC OR 4+ VESSELS/STENTS  |  $96348.81


This mirrors the above results for septicemia and respiratory system diagnosis. The 3rd diagnosis is not very clear. It could encompass abdominal infections and operations. 'MCC' here stands for 'major complications'. Let us see the average difference in charges for these diseases 'with complications' and 'without complications'.

Diagnosis | Average Charge
----------|---------------
870 - SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS | 158949.5
872 - SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W/O MV 96+ HOURS W/O MCC | 27680.9 
871 - SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W/O MV 96+ HOURS W MCC  46028.75

We can see that having a complication could increase charges upto six-fold. This illustrates how errors in coding cost a lot. If one has a hospital bill which seems unusual, such errors need to be looked at.

Which are the providers with highest average charges?

Hospital | Average Charge (dollars)
---------|--------------------------
UVA Health Sciences Center, Charlotesville, VA | 21922.00
Bayonne Hospital Center, Bayonne, NJ | 147441 
Doctors Medical Center, Modesto, CA | 144695
Stanford Hospital, Stanford, CA | 138818
Northbay Medical Center, Fairfield, CA | 138504

Three seem to be from California, which is understandable because of high expenses in CA. Let's explore why the one from VA is expensive. VA ranks 29th among the states for average charges. This is strange. Why should one hospital from VA be so expensive? 

It turns out that there is only one entry for that hospital in the dataset and the diagnosis is "RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS"Let's see how the charge for this diagnosis compares with others in VA


The top 5 diagnoses for this outlier are:

 - 870  SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS   132
 - 329  MAJOR SMALL & LARGE BOWEL PROCEDURES W MCC   117
 - 853  INFECTIOUS & PARASITIC DISEASES W O.R. PROCEDURE W MCC   117
 - 207  RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS    96
 - 460  SPINAL FUSION EXCEPT CERVICAL W/O MCC    15
 

Which is the most expensive to treat overall?


Looks like septicemia is still the overall most expensive

The spinal fusion (code 460) in the outlier list is interesting because it is not there in the overall list. I don't know what it is done for. Let me google and come back.
