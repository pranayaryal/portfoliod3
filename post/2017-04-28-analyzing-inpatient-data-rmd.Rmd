## Let's examine the Hospital Charge Dataset from data.gov
I wanted to analyse this dataset because I wanted to know charges varies with providers. 

Let me give you small snapshot of the dataset

DRG Definition | Provider Id | Provider Name | Provider Street Address | Provider City| Provider State | Provider Zip Code | Hospital Referral Region Descri 
---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------
039 -EXTRACRANIAL PROCEDURES W/O CC OR MCC | 10001 | SOUTHEAST ALABAMA MEDICAL CENTER | 1108 ROSS CLARK CIR | DOTHAN | AL  |  36301 | AL - Dothan 








Total Discharges | Average Covered Charges | Average Total Payments | Average Medicare Payments |
-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|





The dataset has the following columns: 

 - DRG Definition (diagnosis)                       
 - Provider Id                         
 - Provider Name                        
 - Provider Street Address             
 - Provider City                        
 - Provider State                      
 - Provider Zip Code                    
 - Hospital Referral Region Description
 - Total Discharges                     
 - Average Covered Charges             
 - Average Total Payments               
 - Average Medicare Payments  
 
 The Average Covered Charges differs with differing providers. This will be our column of interest. Let us take a look at its histogram after converting the column to a float. We must remember diagnoses have been clubbed together to allow for easy coding and charging. However, the granularity of individual disease is lost

We see a few outliers beyond the 250000 mark. Let's explore who these might be.
There are apparently 513 instances of charges above that. 

The top 5 diagnoses for this outlier are:

 - 870  SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS   132
 - 329  MAJOR SMALL & LARGE BOWEL PROCEDURES W MCC   117
 - 853  INFECTIOUS & PARASITIC DISEASES W O.R. PROCEDURE W MCC   117
 - 207  RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS    96
 - 460  SPINAL FUSION EXCEPT CERVICAL W/O MCC    15
 
Looks like septicemia or severe sepsis with mechanical ventilation is an expensive disease to treat. Mechanical ventilation means that a tube has been inserted a person's windpipe and a machine helps with his breathing. Understandably, this is only done in ICU and is expensive.

Which is the most expensive to treat overall?

- 870 - SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS 163227.33
- 207 - RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS 143428.05
- 853 - INFECTIOUS & PARASITIC DISEASES W O.R. PROCEDURE W MCC 139186.35
- 329 - MAJOR SMALL & LARGE BOWEL PROCEDURES W MCC 135330.94
- 246 - PERC CARDIOVASC PROC W DRUG-ELUTING STENT W MCC OR 4+ VESSELS/STENTS  96348.81

Looks like septicemia is still the overall most expensive

The spinal fusion (code 460) in the outlier list is interesting because it is not there in the overall list. I don't know what it is done for. Let me google and come back.
