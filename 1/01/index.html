<h2>Let’s examine the Hospital Charge Dataset from data.gov</h2>
<p>I wanted to analyse this dataset because I wanted to know the different charges among different providers</p>
<p>The dataset has the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>DRG Definition (diagnosis)<br />
</li>
<li>Provider Id<br />
</li>
<li>Provider Name<br />
</li>
<li>Provider Street Address<br />
</li>
<li>Provider City<br />
</li>
<li>Provider State<br />
</li>
<li>Provider Zip Code<br />
</li>
<li>Hospital Referral Region Description</li>
<li>Total Discharges<br />
</li>
<li>Average Covered Charges<br />
</li>
<li>Average Total Payments<br />
</li>
<li>Average Medicare Payments</li>
</ul>
<p>The Average Covered Charges differs with differing providers. This will be our column of interest. Let us take a look at its histogram after converting the column to a float. We must remember diagnoses have been clubbed together to allow for easy coding and charging. However, the granularity of individual disease is lost because of this.</p>

<p class="caption">Histogram of the Average Charge</p>
</div>
<p>We see a few outliers beyond the 250000 mark. Let’s explore who these might be. There are apparently 513 instances of charges above that.</p>
<p>The top 5 diagnoses for this outlier are:</p>
<ul>
<li>870 SEPTICEMIA OR SEVERE SEPSIS W MV 96+ HOURS 132</li>
<li>329 MAJOR SMALL &amp; LARGE BOWEL PROCEDURES W MCC 117</li>
<li>853 INFECTIOUS &amp; PARASITIC DISEASES W O.R. PROCEDURE W MCC 117</li>
<li>207 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS W VENTILATOR SUPPORT 96+ HOURS 96</li>
<li>460 SPINAL FUSION EXCEPT CERVICAL W/O MCC 15</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like septicemia or severe sepsis with mechanical ventilation is an expensive disease to treat. Mechanical ventilation means that a tube has been inserted a person’s windpipe and a machine helps with his breathing. Understandably, this is only done in ICU and is expensive.</p>
<p>Which is the most expensive to treat overall? Let us try to see that.</p>
